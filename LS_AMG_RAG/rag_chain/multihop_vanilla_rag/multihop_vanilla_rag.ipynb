It may not have all of the advanced health tracking features of the Series 9, but the SE has all of the basics you’d want in a smartwatch, including smart notifications, all-day activity tracking and perks like Fall and Crash Detection and Emergency SOS. If you’re looking for a good entry-point into the Apple Watch space, or a gift for someone who has never worn a smartwatch before, the Apple Watch SE is a great option.\\n\\nApple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen)\\n\\nThe latest version of Apple\\'s AirPods Pro is back on sale for $190 at Amazon, Target and Best Buy. That matches an all-time low and comes in $60 below the pair\\'s usual going rate. The AirPods Pro are the \"best for iOS\" pick in our wireless earbuds buying guide thanks to their easy pairing and deep integration with Apple devices. Effective active noise cancellation (ANC), a superb transparency mode and a pleasingly warm sound profile help as well, as does a new \"adaptive audio\" mode that can adjust the earphones\\' noise control settings based on your surroundings. That said, their battery life is just average at six-ish hours per charge, and you really have to use an iPhone to get anything out of them.\\n\\nWe gave the Lightning-based version of the second-generation AirPods',\n",

It also offers 5,000 mAh of energy, and there's a USB-C port for recharging it, complete with a short cable. However, it might not be a good pick if you have a thick case.\\n\\nThis 2-in-1 charger is featured in our guide to the Best MagSafe Accessories. The price matches the lowest we have tracked. It doesn't have a built-in Apple Watch charger, but it can top off your compatible wireless earbuds whilst simultaneously charging your iPhone. It charges at the maximum 15-watt rate, and you can turn your iPhone sideways for iOS 17’s new StandBy mode, converting it into a bedside alarm clock.\\n\\nAnker 737 Power Bank Photograph: Anker\\n\\nWe just added this power bank as our top upgrade pick in our guide to the Best Portable Chargers. It's pricey, but today's deal makes it more accessible. It charges from zero to completely full in an hour and boasts a whopping 24,000-mAh capacity. And it's powerful enough to charge laptops and tablets as well as phones and other gadgets. There's even a built-in display to monitor stats like temperature and\",\n",

It's small enough to slip into my backpack and fits perfectly on an airplane tray table. With an 8.3-inch display, it's great for watching movies or reading ebooks, as well as sketching and taking notes with the second-generation Apple Pencil. Equipped with an A15 Bionic processor (the same chip powering the 2021 iPhone 13), it can handle taxing apps and games with ease. It should have enough power to last you for many years. It's worth noting Apple is rumored to be launching a next-gen version soon, but this is still a solid tablet if you don't need the latest and greatest.\\n\\nMacBook and Accessory Deals\\n\\nRead our Best MacBooks guide for more info and other options.\\n\\nApple MacBook Air Photograph: Apple\\n\\nThe M1-powered MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite budget MacBook. It's a few years old by now, but it's still one of the most powerful laptops you can buy for this price. It's fast and light and can make quick work of simple office tasks.

The performance is snappy and the integration with the second-generation Apple Pencil makes it excel as a digital notebook.

That deal appears to have sold out, but if you still want the prior generation standard Apple slate, it's now $80 off the MSRP from Walmart. That's about the same as it's sold for these past few months. But we still think it's a good buy and recommend it as the best budget iPad you can buy.\\n\\nCheck out our guide to iPads here.\\n\\nMacBook Cyber Monday deals\\n\\nMacBook Pro (14-inch, 2023, M3)\\n\\nThe base model, 14-inch MacBook Pro with the new M3 chip just came out in October but is $150 off for Cyber Monday. After testing the new chip, we think the base model with 8GB of RAM may quickly get bogged down. If it's within your budget, we recommend the model with 16GB of RAM, which is $150 off at B&H photo. And if you upgrade to a model with the M3 Pro chip for an even speedier experience — you'll get a $200 discount as it's down to $2,199 at B&H Photo.

It delivers the maximum 15-watt charging speed possible, but it's not meant to be held up while you use the phone. It doesn't have a power adapter but includes a USB-C-to-USB-C cable. It'll sit securely on your desk and can charge an Apple Watch, too.\\n\\nThis travel kit from ESR works well if you want something that can prop your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation. It can also display your Apple Watch in Nightstand mode, so you can peek and see how long before you must get out of bed. The main body folds open with a MagSafe charging pad for your iPhone and a slot behind for your AirPods. Unfortunately, it doesn't support fast charging and it's capped at 7.5 watts and 5 watts for the iPhone and Apple Watch, respectively. But it's a good, affordable charger. It dipped a little lower to $40 back in July, but this is still a solid deal.\\n\\nPhone Cases and Accessory Deals\\n\\nBe sure to read our Best MagSafe Accessories and Best iPhone 15 Cases guides for other picks.\\n\\nPhotograph: iOttie\\n\\nWhat we like best about this phone mount is that you can\",\n",

It has often sold for $399 lately so this is still $50 off the typical street price. We don’t think it’s a wild improvement over the previous generation, though it does orient the camera to the landscape edge, which is much better for video calling. The USB-C charging is more modern than the Lightning connector on the 9th gen iPad, but for some reason this model still works with the first generation Apple Pencil (even though the slate came out after the second-gen stylus).\\n\\niPad Air\\n\\nThe base model of the latest generation of the iPad Air has an MSRP of $599 and is now down to $499, a price its hit quite a few times in 2023.
