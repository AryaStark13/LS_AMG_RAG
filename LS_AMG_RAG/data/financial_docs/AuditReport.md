To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Instagram:

## Report on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Instagram, which comprise the balance sheet as of [Fiscal Year End Date], and the related statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements.

## Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

## Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the country where the audit is conducted. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

## Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Instagram as of 31st March 2024, and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with GAAP.
