Ideas:

When I went through these questions The immediate thought I had was what kind of questions the companies would be interested in asking or interested in the system generating responses to. If someone really wants to just know about the progress report he won't use a rag system he will directly open the file and read it. Why will an enterprise bear the cost of hosting such a RAG system over the cloud by paying money for this?
So I need to find out questions which can make companies be interested in using this and willing to pay money for this. 
So few questions I thought are:
Is the company profitable or at a loss?
What are the last three months' sales of the company?
What is the annual projection of revenue of the company for the current FY?
What is the net revenue of the company for the previous two years?
Who are the shareholders of the company and what is the share distribution?
How many employees work in the company?
How many teams are there?
What is the marketing spend of the company?
What is the company's dividend policy for shareholders?
What is the employee turnover rate in the company?

The above questions are something which a company will I think be interested in knowing answers about. So for answering such questions first thing is that we will need all these financial calculations (either llm be able to do that using numbers or do an initial step where we from the document present automate this process of creation of a document which has all these financial information)
Also a good feature could be a pitch desk creation which can be seen by an investor to decide whether to invest in a company or not. This can be really powerful use-case.
